## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `fluxui-development` — Develops UIs with Flux UI Free components. Activates when creating buttons, forms, modals, inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, or UI components; replacing HTML form elements with Flux; working with flux: components; or when the user mentions Flux, component library, UI components, form fields, or asks about available Flux components.
- `livewire-development` — Develops reactive Livewire 4 components. Activates when creating, updating, or modifying Livewire components; working with wire:model, wire:click, wire:loading, or any wire: directives; adding real-time updates, loading states, or reactivity; debugging component behavior; writing Livewire tests; or when the user mentions Livewire, component, counter, or reactive UI.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== fluxui-free/core rules ===

# Flux UI Free

- Flux UI is the official Livewire component library. This project uses the free edition, which includes all free components and variants but not Pro components.
- Use `<flux:*>` components when available; they are the recommended way to build Livewire interfaces.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `fluxui-development` when working with Flux UI components.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces using only PHP — no JavaScript required.
- Instead of writing frontend code in JavaScript frameworks, you use Alpine.js to build the UI when client-side interactions are required.
- State lives on the server; the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions (they're like HTTP requests).
- IMPORTANT: Activate `livewire-development` every time you're working with Livewire-related tasks.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

# ArmaMan - Arma 3 Server Manager

## Project Overview

ArmaMan is a web-based Arma 3 dedicated server manager built with Laravel 12, Livewire 4, and Flux UI. It allows users to install, configure, and manage multiple Arma 3 server instances (including starting/stopping/restarting processes), download Steam Workshop mods via SteamCMD, organize mods into presets, import Arma 3 Launcher HTML preset files, and assign presets to server instances. The application supports headless client management per server. It ships as a single Docker container with SteamCMD bundled inside.

## Scope

- **Arma 3 only** — no DayZ, DayZ Experimental, or Arma Reforger support.
- Full server process control (start/stop/restart) from the web UI.
- Headless client support (launch/stop HC instances per server).
- Arma 3 Launcher HTML preset import supported.

## Domain Concepts

### Game Installs
- A `GameInstall` represents a downloaded copy of the Arma 3 dedicated server files (Steam App ID 233780).
- Multiple installs can exist with different names and branches (public, contact, creatordlc, profiling, performance, legacy).
- Branches are hardcoded — `GetAppBetas` Steam API requires a Steamworks partner token and returns 403 with a regular key.
- Each install tracks: `name`, `branch`, `installation_status` (`GameInstallStatus` enum), `progress_pct` (0–100), `disk_size_bytes`, `installed_at`.
- Installed via `InstallServerJob`, which streams SteamCMD output line-by-line via a callback, parses progress lines, and writes `progress_pct` + `disk_size_bytes` to DB (throttled every 1 percentage point using `updateQuietly`).
- SteamCMD progress line format: `Update state (0x61) downloading, progress: 44.53 (2397543803 / 5384428737)` — emitted roughly every 2 seconds.
- On completion, actual disk size is recorded via `du -sb`.
- All SteamCMD output lines are logged with context prefix: `[GameInstall:1 'stable'] <line>`.
- Each SteamCMD output line and progress update is broadcast via `GameInstallOutput` event for real-time UI updates.

### Server Instances
- Each server **must** be linked to a `GameInstall` (`game_install_id` required — no server without one).
- Configuration is managed inline on the servers index page (expand/collapse panel) — no separate create/edit pages.
- Each server has: name, port, query_port, max_players, password, admin_password, description, headless_client_count, additional_params, active_preset_id, game_install_id.
- Port uniqueness is validated across both `port` and `query_port` columns for all servers.
- Servers can be started, stopped, and restarted from the web UI.
- `Server::getBinaryPath()` derives the server binary path from the linked `GameInstall`.
- `server.cfg` is regenerated on every server start by `ServerProcessService::generateServerConfig()`, so config changes take effect immediately.

### Workshop Mods
- Mods are identified by their Steam Workshop ID (numeric).
- Mods are downloaded using SteamCMD as queued Laravel jobs (one job per mod, `DownloadModJob`).
- Each mod has: `workshop_id`, `name`, `file_size`, `installation_status` (`InstallationStatus` enum), `progress_pct` (0–100), `installed_at`.
- **Progress tracking**: SteamCMD does NOT output progress lines for workshop downloads. Progress is tracked by polling `du -sb` on the mod directory every 1 second while the SteamCMD process runs asynchronously (`Process::start()` + `while ($process->running())`). `progress_pct` is written to DB (throttled every 1 percentage point) using `updateQuietly`.
- Progress and SteamCMD output are broadcast via `ModDownloadOutput` event for real-time UI updates.
- Mod metadata (name, file size) is fetched from the Steam Workshop API before download begins.
- On completion, actual disk size is recorded via `du -sb` on the mod directory.
- Mod files need to be converted to lowercase (Linux requirement for Arma 3).
- Mods are symlinked into server directories when assigned via presets.

### Mod Presets
- A preset is a named collection of workshop mods.
- Presets can be created manually (selecting individual mods) or by importing an Arma 3 Launcher HTML preset file.
- When importing an HTML preset, the system parses mod IDs from the file and queues individual download jobs for each mod.
- A server instance uses one active preset at a time.
- Presets can be shared across multiple server instances.
- Presets have separate create and edit pages (unlike servers which use inline panels).

### Headless Clients
- Each Arma 3 server instance can have headless clients launched alongside it.
- Headless clients offload AI processing from the main server.
- They connect to the server automatically using the server's configured password.
- Users can start/stop headless clients per server from the UI.

### SteamCMD Integration
- SteamCMD is the command-line tool used to download server files and workshop mods.
- SteamCMD commands are executed as queued jobs to prevent blocking the web UI.
- Steam credentials (username, encrypted password, auth_token, steam_api_key) are managed via a settings page and stored encrypted in the database (`SteamAccount` model).
- The SteamCMD binary path is configurable via `STEAMCMD_PATH` env var (default: `/usr/games/steamcmd`).
- Arma 3 server Steam App ID: 233780 (hardcoded in `config/arma.php` as `server_app_id`)
- Arma 3 game ID (for workshop mods): 107410 (hardcoded in `config/arma.php` as `game_id`)
- `SteamCmdService::installServer()` accepts an optional `?callable $onOutput` and streams output line-by-line.
- `SteamCmdService::startDownloadMod()` starts the process asynchronously and returns an `InvokedProcess` for polling.
- `SteamCmdService::downloadMod()` (sync, no callback) still exists but is not used by the job.

## Architecture Decisions

### Queue-Based Downloads
- All SteamCMD operations run as queued Laravel jobs.
- Each mod download is a separate job so progress can be tracked individually.
- The queue worker processes one job at a time to avoid SteamCMD conflicts.
- Uses the `database` queue driver (already configured).

### Real-Time Updates via WebSocket (Laravel Reverb + Echo)
- Laravel Reverb provides the WebSocket server; Laravel Echo (with pusher-js) handles client subscriptions.
- Three broadcast events push real-time data from jobs/commands to the UI:
  - `GameInstallOutput` — SteamCMD log lines + progress for game installs (channel: `game-install.{id}`)
  - `ModDownloadOutput` — progress + SteamCMD output for mod downloads (channel: `mod-download.{id}`)
  - `ServerLogOutput` — server log lines from the `server:tail-log` command (channel: `server-log.{id}`)
- All broadcast events implement `ShouldBroadcastNow` (they are already dispatched from queue workers or commands).
- All channels are public (no authorization needed) — no entries in `routes/channels.php`.
- Livewire components use `getListeners()` to dynamically subscribe to per-entity Echo channels (e.g. `echo:game-install.{id},GameInstallOutput`).
- Game installs and mods pages have **no `wire:poll`** — they rely entirely on Echo events for updates.
- Servers page uses `wire:poll.5s` for process status checks + Echo for real-time log streaming.
- Progress (`progress_pct`) is still written to DB by jobs; Echo events carry it too for instant UI updates.

### Server Config Generation
- `ServerProcessService::generateServerConfig()` writes `server.cfg` to `getProfilesPath()/server.cfg` before every server start.
- Maps DB fields: `name` → `hostname`, `password`, `admin_password` → `passwordAdmin`, `max_players` → `maxPlayers`, `description` → `motd[]`.
- Includes Arma 3 defaults (BattlEye=1, verifySignatures=2, etc.).
- Config is always regenerated on start so changes take effect immediately.

### Server Log Tailing
- `TailServerLog` artisan command (`server:tail-log {server}`) tails a running server's `server.log` file.
- Polls at 250ms intervals, handles file rotation.
- Broadcasts each new line via `ServerLogOutput` event over WebSocket.
- Started/stopped automatically by `ServerProcessService` alongside the server process (PID file managed).

### Livewire Components
- Single-file Livewire components in `resources/views/pages/` using the `pages::` namespace.
- No `⚡` emoji prefixes on filenames (`livewire.php` has `make_command.emoji => false`).
- Server create/edit is inline on the servers index page (modal for create, expand panel for edit) — no separate pages.
- `flux:select` with a bound integer property: pre-initialise the property in the open method (e.g. `$this->gameInstalls->first()?->id`) to avoid the flux:select null-on-no-interaction bug.

### File System Layout
- Game install files: `{SERVERS_BASE_PATH}/game/{game_install_id}/`
- Workshop mods: `{MODS_BASE_PATH}/steamapps/workshop/content/107410/{workshop_id}/`
- Mod symlinks into server dirs: `{server_path}/@{normalized_mod_name}`
- All paths are configurable via environment variables.

### Docker Deployment
- The application ships as a single Docker container.
- The container includes: PHP-FPM, Nginx, SteamCMD, Node.js (for asset building), SQLite.
- Supervisord manages: Nginx, PHP-FPM, the Laravel queue worker, and Laravel Reverb (WebSocket server on port 8080).
- Storage volumes for: database, server files, mod files, Laravel storage.
- A `docker-compose.yml` is provided for easy deployment.
- `storage/arma/servers` and `storage/arma/mods` are gitignored.

### Environment Variables (Custom)
- `STEAMCMD_PATH` - Path to SteamCMD executable (default: `/usr/games/steamcmd`)
- `STEAM_API_KEY` - Steam Web API key for fetching workshop mod metadata
- `SERVERS_BASE_PATH` - Base directory for game install downloads
- `MODS_BASE_PATH` - Base directory for mod downloads

## SteamCMD Commands Reference

### Install/Update Arma 3 Server
```
steamcmd +force_install_dir {install_path} +login {username} {password} +app_update 233780 validate +quit
# For non-public branch:
steamcmd +force_install_dir {install_path} +login {username} {password} +app_update 233780 -beta {branch} validate +quit
```

### Download Workshop Mod
```
steamcmd +force_install_dir {mods_base_path} +login {username} {password} +workshop_download_item 107410 {workshop_id} validate +quit
```

## Testing Notes
- Mock `SteamCmdService` directly in job tests (bind via `$this->app->instance()`).
- For `DownloadModJob` tests: mock `startDownloadMod()` to return a mock `InvokedProcess` with `running()` returning `false` and `wait()` returning a mock `ProcessResult`. Use `Process::fake(['du *' => Process::result('SIZE\t/path')])` to fake disk size reads.
- For `InstallServerJob` tests: mock `installServer()` to invoke the callback with fake output lines if testing progress parsing.
- `setUp()` in `ServerManagementTest` always creates a `GameInstall` — tests that need `createGameInstallId` to be null must explicitly `->set('createGameInstallId', null)` after `openCreateModal`.
- `SteamWorkshopService` no longer has `getDownloadProgress()` or `getDownloadedSize()` — do not mock them.
- Broadcast events use `ShouldBroadcastNow` — when testing dispatches from jobs, use `Event::fake([SpecificEvent::class])` to avoid breaking other event-driven behavior.
- `Process::fake()` does not intercept `rm -rf` calls in Livewire component tests reliably — use real filesystem + `assertDirectoryDoesNotExist` instead.
