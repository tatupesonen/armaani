# Armaani

Armaani _(Finnish for *"my dear"*)_ is a web-based game server manager for Arma 3, Arma Reforger, and (soon) DayZ. Install, configure, and manage dedicated server instances from a single UI.

Built with Laravel 12, Inertia v2, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and with a bunch of help from Claude.

## Docker Deployment

The recommended way to run Armaani is with Docker. The image bundles SteamCMD, PHP, Caddy, and everything else into a single container.

### Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Armaani on port 80 (HTTP). On first boot the container will:

1. Run database migrations
2. Create a default admin account with a random password
3. Print the credentials to the container logs

Grab the login credentials from the logs:

```bash
docker logs armaani
```

Look for the `ADMIN ACCOUNT CREATED` box with the email and password.

### Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
    armaani:
        build: .
        container_name: armaani
        network_mode: host
        volumes:
            - ./storage:/var/www/html/storage
        environment:
            - SITE_ADDRESS=:80
        restart: unless-stopped
```

| Variable       | Default | Description                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SITE_ADDRESS` | `:80`   | Set to a domain (e.g. `arma.example.com`) to enable automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt. Use `:PORT` for plain HTTP on a specific port. |

### HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Set `SITE_ADDRESS` to your domain and Caddy will automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates:

```yaml
environment:
    - SITE_ADDRESS=arma.example.com
```

Requirements: ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from the internet, and DNS must point to the server.

### Volume

A single volume mount persists all data:

```yaml
volumes:
    - ./storage:/var/www/html/storage
```

This contains the SQLite database, game installs, server configs, mods, missions, backups, TLS certificates, and the `.env` file. Back up this directory.

### Network

`network_mode: host` is required because game servers bind to dynamic ports that can't be predicted ahead of time.

### Admin Account

On first boot, a default admin user is created automatically:

- **Email:** `admin@armaani.local`
- **Password:** randomly generated (shown once in the logs)

To use custom credentials:

```yaml
services:
    armaani:
        # ...
        command: ['--email=you@example.com', '--password=your-password']
```

Or override the admin after startup:

```bash
docker exec armaani php artisan user:create-admin --email=you@example.com --password=secret
```

> The command is a no-op if users already exist. To reset, delete the SQLite database and restart.

### Building the Image Manually

```bash
docker build -t armaani .
docker run -d --name armaani --network host -v ./storage:/var/www/html/storage armaani
```

## Local Development

- Node.js 22+
- SQLite
- SteamCMD

### Setup

```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
npm run build
```

### Running

```bash
composer run dev
```

### Testing
