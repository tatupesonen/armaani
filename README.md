# Armaani

Armaani _(Finnish for *"my dear"*)_ is a web-based game server manager for Arma 3, Arma Reforger, and (soon) DayZ. Install, configure, and manage dedicated server instances from a single UI.

Built with Laravel 12, Inertia v2, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and with a bunch of help from Claude.
